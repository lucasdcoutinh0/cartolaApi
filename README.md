## -> The Main branch:
  
  <br/>

  On the ```main``` branch we have a basic RESTFUL API doing a CRUD with Node, Express and Mongoose.

  This version of the Api is very limited because uses the free version of Mongoose so it doesn't contain all possible data and functionality.

  <br/>

## -> The Local branch:

<br/>

The ```local``` branch store all the data into json files, the objective is just enable the use of this info in a more simple way in the FrontEnd. This Branch only have the GET method.
